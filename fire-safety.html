    <h1>Fire Safety</h1>
    <h4>Home Fire Drills</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Know what your smoke alarm and carbon monoxide detector sound like.</li>
      <li>Pretend that there is a fire. Practice exiting the house.</li>
      <li>Use a whistle, horn, bell, or other signal to start you drill. Don't use a lit match, lighter, etc. to set off a smoke alarm because it could cause a real fire.</li>
      <li>Know how to roll out of bed onto the floor; crawl and your hands and knees below smoke where the air is clearer, and crawl backwards down stairs. If the room is smoky, cover your nose and mouth with a damp cloth the keep from breathing in smoke.</li>
      <li>Go straight to your Safe Meeting Place once safely outside.</li>
      <li>No one should ever go back inside for anything.</li>
      <li>Practice your drill during the day, at night, and in all types of weather.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Fire Facts</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Studies show that from the time a fire breaks out, a person has less than 4 minutes to escape the disabling effects of smoke and poisonous gases.</li>
      <li>Smoke can engulf a home in under 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Smoke alarms sense smoke or other products of combustion before they can affects your senses.</li>
      <li>Smoke and deadly gases rise, so you will need to crawl low, below the smoke where the air is clearer to exit safely, all the way out, if necessary.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Know What To Do When Your Carbon Monoxide Detector Sounds</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>If the CO detector sounds, leave even if you do not feel symptoms. Follow your Home Fire Escape Plan. Open doors and windows on your way out.</li>
      <li>Dial 9-1-1. Seek medical attention if you have symptoms. If the alarm sounds and there are no symptoms, dial a qualified appliance technician.</li>
      <li>If you suspect a leak or smell gas, call your local utility immediately. Never re-enter the home until you are told it's safe.</li>
    </ol>
    <h6>Symptoms of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning</h6>
    <p>Symptoms can be like a common cold, the flu (without body ache or fever), a hangover or intoxication, food poisoning, depression, or sea sickness.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Dizziness, fainting, bad headaches</li>
      <li>Ears ringing, blurred vision, forehead tightness</li>
      <li>Appearing drunk</li>
      <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
      <li>Disorientation, loss of muscle control</li>
      <li>Fatigue, sleepiness</li>
      <li>Shortness of breath, unusual heart activity</li>
      <li>Sudden death</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Fire Extinguishers</h4>
    <p>Fire extinguishers should only be used by adults (unless you're a younger person that was trained). Most homes use a "multi-purpose" Class A-B-C extinguisher.</p>
    <p>Remember the PASS-word to use a fire extinguisher:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>P - pull the pin (or other motion) to unlock it.</li>
      <li>A - aim at the base of the fire, 6 to 10 feet away.</li>
      <li>S - squeeze the lever to discharge the agent.</li>
      <li>S - sweep spray left to right until the flames are out.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>*Only fight small fires*</p>
